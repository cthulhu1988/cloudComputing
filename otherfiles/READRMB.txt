demo01 uses:
    1 (server.php)
        (**** run on a server)
        I copied ALL of ../content/ws  to  vwg@vws:rbutler/ws then,
        logged in there as vwg@vws I ran:
            php server.php
        Note:  This should run on any server that has php installed.
    2 (demo01.html)
    3 (websocket.css)
    4 (websocket01.js)
demo02 is like demo01, but uses websocket02.js instead.
